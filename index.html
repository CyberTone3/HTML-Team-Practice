                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <p>To make the pastry, in a food processor, combine the flour, cornmeal, sugar and salt. Scatter the butter pieces over the top and pulse for a few seconds until they are the size of small peas. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and ice water, drizzle over the dough and pulse until it is smooth and clings together. Flatten the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, make the filling: In a large fry pan over medium heat, combine the sugar, 1/2 cup (4 fl. oz./125 ml) water, the honey, lemon juice and cinnamon and cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the apple slices and simmer until the apples begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the apple slices to a bowl. Add the cranberries to the fry pan and simmer until they start to pop, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, add the cranberries to the apples. Boil the liquid over medium-high heat until reduced slightly. Spoon over the fruit.</p>
                <p>Position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
                <p>Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece into a round about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Divide the filling equally between the pastry rounds and spread it in an even layer, leaving a 1 1/2-inch (4-cm) border uncovered. Fold the border over the fruit, pleating the edges to form a rim. Arrange the butter slices evenly on the exposed fruit.</p>
                <p>Bake the galettes, rotating them halfway through the cooking time, until the pastry is golden brown and the apples are tender, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let the galettes cool completely before serving. Garnish each galette with a dollop of crème fraîche, thyme sprigs, sea salt and honey. Makes three 5-inch (13-cm) galettes; serves 12.</p>
